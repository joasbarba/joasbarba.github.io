# Flexible Chronogram Models

*Three adaptable chronogram models for different production scenarios*

## 1. "COLLECTIVE" CHRONOGRAM (For group production)

| Stage | Estimated Time | Variables | Checkpoint |
|-------|----------------|-----------|------------|
| Collaborative writing (7 blocks divided among participants) | 2-4 weeks | Level of group involvement | Drafts of all 7 blocks ready |
| Rhythm tests (Pilot version recording) | 1-2 weeks | Musician availability | Beat defined for 2 blocks |
| Lyrics review (Metric and rhyme adjustment) | 1 week | Poetic requirement level | "Singable" version of 50% |
| In-person rehearsals (By thematic block) | 3-6 weeks | Rehearsal frequency | 3 blocks rehearsed with choreography |
| Finalization (Recording/Registry) | 1-2 weeks | Technical resources | Project archived or released |

**Notes:**
- If one block is delayed, prioritize those with repetitive refrains (easier to adapt)
- Use online tools (Google Docs, Trello) to synchronize the group

## 2. "SOLO" CHRONOGRAM (Individual production)

| Stage | Estimated Time | Tips | Progress Signal |
|-------|----------------|------|----------------|
| Thematic research (References by block) | 1-2 weeks | Organize a "database" with quotes and songs | List of 20+ references |
| Layered writing (1 block/day) | 7-10 days | Start with the most intuitive blocks (e.g., Rastafari) | Complete draft (420 lines) |
| Guided recording (Use ready beats) | 1 week | Use apps like Soundtrap or BandLab | 3 blocks recorded |
| Lyrical review (Adjustment for performance) | 3-5 days | Record yourself and listen for "jams" | Fluid version of 70% |
| Distribution (Social media/Website) | Continuous | Release in parts (e.g., 1 block/week) | 100% published |

**Notes:**
- If creative block hits, skip to another block and return later
- Trick: Record "ugly" versions first (just to structure time)

## 3. "PERFORMANCE" CHRONOGRAM (Focus on live performance)

| Stage | Minimum Time | Ideal Time | Priority |
|-------|--------------|------------|----------|
| Block selection (Choose 3-5 most impactful) | 1 day | 3 days | Define emotional climax |
| Stage adaptation (Choreography, props) | 1 week | 3 weeks | Test with test audience |
| Technical rehearsals (Sound, lighting, battery) | 2 days | 10 days | Ensure memorable refrain |
| Pre-premiere (Experimental show) | 1 night | 3 performances | Collect feedback |
| Final version (Post-test adjustments) | 1-2 days | 1 week | Precise timing |

**Notes:**
If time is short, prioritize:
- Main refrain (that audience learns quickly)
- USP block (intellectual differential)
- Epic finale (to leave a message)

## PLAN B (If everything goes "wrong")
**"Lightning" Version:**
- 1 block (Exu or Rastafari) + 420 Line Refrain â†’ 5 minutes
- Use a ready-made maracatu-reggae beat
- Simple choreography: samba steps + symbolic gestures (e.g., hands imitating leaves)

**Zero availability?**
- Transform into spoken poem (20 min) or illustrated zine

## HOW TO USE THESE CHRONOGRAMS
- Mark non-negotiable stages in red (e.g., rehearsals)
- Leave flexible stages in orange (e.g., thematic research)
- Use post-its to adjust deadlines according to reality
